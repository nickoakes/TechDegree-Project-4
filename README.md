# TechDegree-Project-4

A 'Hangman'-style game in which the player has to guess the letters in a phrase, for which placeholders are displayed on-screen.

Letters can be entered both by clicking the on-screen keyboard, and by hitting keys on the user's real keyboard.

Incorrect letters become orange when selected, while correct ones become dark blue.

The <h2> element at the top of the page animates to indicate whether the letter chosen is correct or not.

'Game over' occurs either when the player correctly guesses all letters in the phrase, or when they have made five incorrect guesses and thereby lost all of their lives - represented by the heart shapes at the bottom of the screen. On 'Game over', an overlay is displayed to inform the user whether they have won or lost, and give them the option to start a new game.

Written to meet 'Exceeds Expectations' standard.
